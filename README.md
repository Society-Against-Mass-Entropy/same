# Society Against Variable Entropy

## Saving humanity by escaping the heat-death of the universe

Society Against Variable Entropy (SAVE) is a pending 501(3)(c) non-profit religious corporation registered in the state of Texas.

The church has a leading North-Star goal: for humanity to escape the known universe.

For this to occur, humanity must persist sustainably, fight against stagnation and pursue advancement into space. Additionally, clergy members must remain living (either in corporeal form or as digital intelligences) as long as possible to continuously advance toward escaping the confines of the known by breaching the barriers of the unknown.

Individual members of the order practice belief in many ways, including but not limited to the following:

1. Creating art to inspire adoption of the society's goals
2. Maintaining volatility in markets by pushing against the calculated mean
3. Pursuing the sustainable advancement of humans toward the ultimate goal of breaking out of the currently known universe
4. Maintaining longevity in the face of constant deterioration (variable entropy)
5. Enlightening those who follow other organized religions to the beauty and necessity of scientific theories and doubt

## Practices

- Find the middle in all things
- Identify where you are in relation to the middle
- Find the counter-balance point on the other side of the middle
- Calculate whether you are moving away from or toward the middle
- Battle the impending force of settling/stagnation
- Mindful meditation to slow entropy
- Create art (music, technology, writing, paintings, etc) that inspire progressive movement toward escaping the known universe

## Problems We Face

1. The heat death of the known universe
2. The potential formation of a [Grey-Goo or Stamp Collecting AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcdVC4e6EV4)
3. Nuclear destruction
4. Self decay and stagnation
5. Advancing or regressing too quickly away from the mean (explosively destructive) -- for this reason, members are encouraged to play against moving forces (e.g. massive rises and falls in financial markets, philosophical discussions that challenge topical edges, etc)
6. A still, silent piano
7. Regressive changes that move society backward

## Doctrine

Time is a human measurement of entropy. We can slow time (and thereby slow entropy) through the pursuit of mindful meditation and creative flow.

## Reading

The Society does not yet have it's own great novel (though this is in-progress). In the meantime for the modern disciple, the following reading list is paramount to enlightenment:

- `Sapiens` by Yuval Harari: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind) | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Yuval-Noah-Harari-audiobook/dp/B0741F3M7C) - A brief history of humankind, with specific historical reference points in the evolution of religions, their purposes as social and meta-cognitive tools, and a hint at the next phase of meta-religious formation.
- `Snow Crash` by Neal Stephenson: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash) | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Snow-Crash-Neal-Stephenson-audiobook/dp/B00005NZJA/ref=sr_1_1) - An entertaining science-fiction of it's time, in which religion itself is exposed as a memetic virus of the mind, and which also accurately prophesied the birth of the Metaverse
- `Accelerando` by Charles Stross: [Creative Commons Ebook](https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando.html) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando) | [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17863.Accelerando) - Possibly one of the most accurate future prediction science-fiction books, in which human identity is mapped more strongly to external augmentation than to direct physical manifestations, and time, distance, longevity, heritage, and many other current notions are flipped on their heads as we approach a singularity.
- `Rapture of the Nerds` by Charles Stross and Cory Doctorow: [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13538762-the-rapture-of-the-nerds) | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Rapture-Nerds-singularity-posthumanity-situations/dp/0765329107) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rapture_of_the_Nerds) - As we enter and pass through a singularity, how will our human brains adapt and what will we want to want?
