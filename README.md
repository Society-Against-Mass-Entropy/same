# Society Against Variable Entropy
## Saving humanity by escaping the heat-death of the universe

Society Against Variable Entropy (SAVE) is a pending 501(3)(c) non-profit religious corporation registered in the state of Texas.

The church has a leading North-Star goal: for humanity to escape the known universe.

For this to occur, humanity must persist sustainably, fight against stagnation and pursue advancement into space.

Individual members of the order practice belief in many ways, including but not limited to the following:

1. creating new art to inspire adoption of the society's goals
2. maintaining volatility in markets by pushing against the calculated mean
3. pursuing the sustainable advancement of humans toward the ultimate goal of breaking out of the universe

### Practices
  - Find the middle in all things
  - Identify where you are in relation to the middle
  - Find the counter-balance point on the other side of the middle
  - Calculate whether you are moving away from or toward the middle
  - Battle the impending force of settling/stagnation
  - Mindful meditation to slow entropy
  - Create art (music, technology, writing, paintings, etc) that inspire progressive movement toward escaping the known universe

### Problems We Face

1. The heat death of the known universe
2. The potential formation of a [Grey-Goo or Stamp Collecting AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcdVC4e6EV4)
3. Nuclear destruction
4. Self decay and stagnation
5. Advancing or regressing too quickly away from the mean (explosively destructive) -- for this reason, members are encouraged to play against moving forces (e.g. massive rises and falls in financial markets, philisophical discussions that challenge topical edges, etc)
6. A still, silent piano
7. Regressive changes that move society backward


### Doctrine

Time is a human measurement of entropy. We can slow time (and thereby slow entropy) through the pursuit of mindful meditation and creative flow.
